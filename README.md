An overview for Smart Classroom Management System

This repo shows the website for Smart Classroom Management System. It is an IoT framework that focused on three analysis modules: face recognition, motion analysis, and behaviour understanding to effectively perform classroom monitoring tasks such as taking attendance, identify entering and leaving activities and analyse the students concentration level.

A conference paper also has been published for this project.
